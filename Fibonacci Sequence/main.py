# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It is often used in algorithm examples, and is defined by the following formula: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

# Your task is to implement the Fibonacci algorithm in three different methods: 1. Recursively 2. Iteratively 3. Using Memoization

# Example 1:

# Input:

# n = 5
# Output:

# fibonacci(n) -> 5
# Example 2:

# Input:

# n = 10
# Output:

# fibonacci(n) -> 55
# The Fibonacci sequence starts as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55â€¦

#Recursive Method

def iterative_fibonacci(n):

#Memoization Method
